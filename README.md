Hi there! I'm a Peruvian programmer who has been studying programming since before the pandemic. I'm passionate about the world of technology and always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills. Currently, I'm studying software engineering.

Although I don't have any noteworthy projects yet, I'm always willing to collaborate on interesting projects and work as part of a team to grow and learn. If you have a project in mind and need a developer, feel free to contact me.
